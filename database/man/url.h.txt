URL.H(3)		   Library Functions Manual		      URL.H(3)

NAME
       url.h - contains tools for working with URL specification addresses

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ncsnet/url.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The <url.h> provides a convenient interface for working with addresses
       of the URL specification, which, by the way, is approved in the
       following documents, (RFC 3986, RFC 4248, RFC 4266, RFC 6270, RFC
       1738). The interface in url.h has almost full support for them, except
       for URLs of the PROSPERO type, even so, you can hardly find PROSPERO
       URLs anywhere but RFCs.

       The url_t structure is used to store addresses, and it is with objects
       of this structure that all functions of this header work; it looks like
       this,

       struct url_query	    { char *query; char *value; struct url_query *nxt; };
       struct url_path	    { char *path; struct url_path *nxt; };
       struct url_authority { char *host; char *userinfo; char *port; };

       typedef struct url_addr
       {
	 char*		       scheme;
	 struct url_authority *authority;
	 struct url_path      *path;
	 struct url_query     *query;
	 char		      *fragment;
	 int		       type;
       } url_t;

       NOTE: to familiarize yourself with the fields you can read the RFC
       versions of which were mentioned above, especially 1738.
